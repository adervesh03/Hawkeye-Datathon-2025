### Context
FutureBright Insurance’s automobile division wants to improve its ability to assess customer risk. Currently, underwriting decisions rely on broad rating tables and limited historical averages. By building a risk segmentation model, your team aims to use data-driven insights to:
- Quantify each policyholder’s expected loss (claim cost per exposure).
- Classify potential customers into Low, Medium, and High risk segments.
- Enable more accurate pricing, targeted underwriting, and strategic marketing.
### Goal: Segment Risk Profiles
Approach:
- Use the predicted expected losses to cluster policies into low, medium, and high-risk groups.
- Visualize risk distribution by features like vehicle age, driver age, region, or policy type.
- Deploy to cloud and website - business members select new customer information, and our feature returns the customer's risk level

### Value:
- Enables differentiated pricing or eligibility thresholds.
